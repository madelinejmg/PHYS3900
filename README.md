<h2>Stellar Astrophysics Research </h2>

Stellar evolution models show that most of the lithium in red giants, taken with the Very Large Telescope in Chile, is destroyed when a star goes through the first dredge up phase after the main sequence.
However, ~1% of red giants are lithium-rich. The leading theories to explain lithium-enrichment in red giants is mass transfer from an asymptotic giant branch star, or tidal interactions with a binary star.
This project aims to test the binarity of red giants, by using spectra to measure radial velocities and chemical abundances of these objects.
